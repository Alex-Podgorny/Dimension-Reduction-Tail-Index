# Dimension Reduction Tail Index

This supplementary material repository contains code, data, instructions and reproducible results from the article:

> Laurent Gardes and Alex Podgorny. "Dimension reduction for the estimation of the conditional tail-index".  

- Preprint (2024): [hal-04589742](https://hal.science/hal-04589742)

## Project Structure

- **Methods**: Contains R scripts for the estimation of the conditional tail index, including dimensionality reduction methods. This folder includes my proposed method for Conditional Tail Index (CTI) subspace estimation, alongside competitor methodsâ€”TDR space (Gardes 2018) and TIREX (Aghbalou et al. 2024).

- **Simulations**: Contains R scripts to generate data for various models, apply the different estimation methods, compute errors, and display results. This folder also includes generated data to ensure reproducibility.

- **Real Data**: Contains the real-world dataset used in the article, along with R scripts for applying my method and displaying results for this dataset.
  
## Observational Data Availability

In the case study application, we use the daily concentration pollutants in Chicagofrom 1987 to 2000. These data were obtained few years ago from the Internet-based Health and Air Pollution Surveillance System (iHAPSS) website but unfortunately they are no longer available.
